# frequency-calculator
This application calculate frequency for different octave intervals.

```
ek@efraimkaov:~# chmod +x fc.py
ek@efraimkaov:~# ./fc.py
```

Should work in Linux / Windows / Mac OS X (tested in Linux and Windows).

Soon I will add description and installation script for Linux only.
